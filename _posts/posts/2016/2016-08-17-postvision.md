This is a custom demo website and database I built from scratch for POST VISION last summer which was never finished. The site was built using a customized Wagtail CMS backend which allowed for M2M associations of artists and artworks and used a from-scratch front-end using Backbone.js, Require.js, Handlebars.js, and Video.js with a custom player skin. Website design by Emily Dubovoy.
