As part of the show EXO EMO at Greene Naftali, curated by Antoine Catala, I created custom software for Momoyo Torimitsu which would allow users to select a type of professional smile and would then apply that smile to a blank-face photo of the user and show this as a video animation. This was a re-creation of a piece from 2007 which required users to manually mark feaures of their face to accomplish the smile animation. For this iteration I used Python OpenCV and the candide3 facial model for the facial-reconstruction engine with a custom single-page Node.js / Handlebars.js user interface which communicated with each other through OSC. Alex Hayden fabricated the custom button interface for the piece.
